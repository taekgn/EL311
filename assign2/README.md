# EL311 Further Arduino IDE/Programming

### Assessment
The following design brief should be implemented: 

**• Reaction Timer:** a push button should start the timer, when an LED should light. This
LED should go out after a random time period. The user should press the push button
again as quickly as possible. If the reaction time is above a particular threshold (reaction
too slow) then one LED will light, otherwise the other LED will light (quick reaction).  
**• Musical Organ:** the potentiometer should control the pitch of the note being played.
However, rather than playing a continuous range of frequencies, the following notes (or
a subsection of these notes) should be played:

#### What you should submit
You should submit a single report containing your source code for implementing the two projects
described above.
Reports should be saved as a single Word document or PDF and uploaded to Moodle by the
submission deadline.
#### Marking Scheme
Reaction timer source code 7  
Comments within reaction timer source code 3  
Musical organ source code 7  
Comments within musical organ source code 3  
TOTAL 20  
**ENSURE THAT THIS WORK IS YOUR OWN. ANY PLAGARISED WORK WILL BE GIVEN A MARK
OF ZERO, INCLUDING THE WORK THAT WAS ORGINALLY COPIED.**
